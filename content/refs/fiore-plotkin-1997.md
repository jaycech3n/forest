We relate certain models of Axiomatic Domain Theory (ADT) and Synthetic Domain Theory (SDT). On the one hand, we introduce a class of non-elementary models of SDT and show that the domains in them yield models of ADT. On the other hand, for each model of ADT in a wide class we construct a model of SDT such that the domains in it provide a model of ADT which conservatively extends the original model.
