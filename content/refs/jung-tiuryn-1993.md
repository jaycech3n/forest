We give a new characterization of lambda definability in Henkin models using logical relations defined over ordered sets with varying arity. The advantage of this over earlier approaches by Plotkin and Statman is its simplicity and universality. Yet, decidability of lambda definability for hereditarily finite Henkin models remains an open problem. But if the variable set allowed in terms is also restricted to be finite then our techniques lead to a decision procedure.
