One of the design principles for [](tfmt-0003) described by Matuschak is atomicity ([Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes?stackedNotes=z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1)): a note should capture just one thing, and if possible, *all* of that thing. A related point is that it should be possible to understand a note by (1) reading it, and (2) traversing the notes that it links to and recursively understanding those notes.

Traditional mathematical notes do *not* achieve this kind of atomicity: understanding the meaning of a particular node (e.g. a theorem or definition) usually requires understanding everything that came (textually) before it. In the context of the [hierarchical organization of evergreen mathematical notes](tfmt-0005), this would translate to needing to go *upward* in the hierarchy in order to understand the meaning of a leaf node. I regard this property of traditional mathematical notes as a defect: **we should prefer explicit context over implicit context**.

High-equality mathematical notes should make sense without context; hierarchical context is imposed in order to tell a story, but consumers of mathematical notes should not be forced into a particular narrative. Indeed, as many different hierarchical structures can be imposed, many different narratives can be explored.

My first exploration of hypertext mathematics was the lecture notes [](frct-003I); in hindsight, these lecture notes are very much traditional lecture notes, not written with the atomicity principle in mind. As a result, it is often difficult to understand a given node without ascending upward in the hierarchy.
