Given a path of [reflection algebras](jms-003O) {#X,Y:\Comma{A}{\UU}#} and a [homomorphism](jms-003O) {#f : X\multimap Y#}, the type {#\Sum{g:X\multimap Y}{g\approx f}#} of homomorphisms equipped with a homotopy to {#f#} is contractible, by function extensionality and the characterization of path spaces in dependent sums. Hence it follows that the canonical map {#\TpIdn{X\multimap Y}{f}{g}\to f\approx g#} is an equivalence.
