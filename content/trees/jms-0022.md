We say that a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo {#A#} has an *open positivity predicate* if and only if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. The positivity predicate {#\Mor{\IsPos}{\Gamma A}{\Omega}#} tracks a continuous morphism of dcpos {#\Mor{\IsPos}{A}{\Sigma}#}.

2. The embedding {#\Mor{\iota^+}{A^+}{A}#} is a Scott-open immersion.

3. For a directed subset {#I\subseteq A#}, if {#\bigsqcup{A}#} is positive then there exists an element {#a\in I#} that is positive in {#A#}.
