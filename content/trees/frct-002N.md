Conversely to [the closure of a class of sets under change of base](frct-002M), we may take a class of *families* of sets {#\mathfrak{F}#} to the the class of sets {#\mathfrak{F}\Sub{1}\subseteq{\mathscr{M}}#} spanned by sets {#S#} such that the singleton family {#\brc{S}#} lies in {#\mathfrak{C}#}.
