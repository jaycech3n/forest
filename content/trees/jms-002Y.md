At first glance, the definitions of the [way-below relation](jms-002V) and [positivity](jms-001M) appear very similar:

![](jms-002V)

![](jms-001M)

One is tempted to assert "an element {#a:A#} of a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo {#A#} is [positive](jms-001M) if and only if {#\bot\WayBelow a#}", but note that positivity involves a semidirected subset whereas [way-below](jms-002V) involves a *directed* subset. Indeed, we always have {#\bot\WayBelow a#}.
