An element {#u#} of an {#\Lift#}-algebra {#M#} is *positive* when for any subdirected subset {#I\subseteq UM#}, if {#u\leq \bigsqcup{I}#} then {#I#} is inhabited. We will write {#\IsPos\,{u}#} to mean that {#u#} is a positive element.

(This definition is from Johnstone to the case of dcpos by Tom de Jong.)
