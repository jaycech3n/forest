An element {#u#} of a [pointed](jms-001S) dpco {#A#} is called *positive* when for any semidirected subset {#I\subseteq A#}, if {#u\sqsubseteq \bigsqcup{I}#} then {#I#} is inhabited. We will write {#\IsPos\,{u}#} to mean that {#u#} is a positive element.

(This is adapted from [Johnstone](johnstone-1984)'s definition of positive elements of frames to the case of dcpos by [Tom de Jong](dejong-2023-thesis).)
