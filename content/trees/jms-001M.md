An element {#u#} of a pointed dpco {#A#} is called *positive* when for any semidirected subset {#I\subseteq A#}, if {#u\leq \bigsqcup{I}#} then {#I#} is inhabited. We will write {#\IsPos\,{u}#} to mean that {#u#} is a positive element.

(This is adapted from Johnstone's definition of positive elements of frames to the case of dcpos by Tom de Jong.)
