We have already seen in {{<cref frct-000G>}} and {{<cref frct-000L>}} that smallness in the
sense of the definition above appropriately generalizes the ordinary notion of
smallness for categories over $\SET$. Another perspective on smallness is given
by the *internal language*, in which a category is viewed as an algebra for the
"theory of categories" computed in another category with enough structure. The
notion of internal categories is credited (independently) to Alexander
Grothendieck and Charles Ehresmann.

The notion of a (meta-)category is an essentially algebraic theory. As such it is possible to compute *models* of this theory in any category that has finite limits.
