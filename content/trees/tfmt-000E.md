Many non-{#\LaTeX#} hypertext tools boast some compatibility with mathematical typesetting: for instance, in any HTML-based tool it is possible to use MathML or, for better cross-browser support and easier authoring, import [{#\KaTeX#}](https://katex.org/) or [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). For instance: [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) all support rendering of {#\LaTeX#} math code using either {#\KaTeX#} or MathJax. **Unfortunately, the "support" provided is so limited that it is not usable for a working mathematician --- so it is somewhat puzzling why the support is present in the first place.** Here we will discuss some fundamental requirements for any tool that aims to support mathematical note, without which it is not applicable for use by professionals.
