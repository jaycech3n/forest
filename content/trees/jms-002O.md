So far we have studied [positivity](jms-001M) as an order-theoretic property of domains; in this section, we explore a non-order-theoretic generalization of this condition that is applicable in the setting of axiomatic domain theory. This notion is inspired by the [alternative characterization positivity in terms of partial elements](jms-002T).
