Let {#A#} be a [positively generated](jms-0023) pointed dcpo. Then {#A#} has an [open positivity predicate](jms-0022).

{{%proof "Constructive proof"%}}
Let {#I\subseteq A#} be a directed subset such that {#\bigsqcup{I}#} is positive; we must find a positive element of {#I#}. Because {#A#} is [positively generated](jms-0023) we know that {#\bigsqcup{I} \leq \bigsqcup\prn{I\cap A^+}#}. Because {#\bigsqcup{I}#} is positive and {#I\cap A^+#} [is semidirected](jms-0028), it follows that the latter is inhabited.
