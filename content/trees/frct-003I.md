We assume knowledge of basic categorical concepts such as categories, functors, and natural transformations. The purpose of this lecture is to develop the notion of a category *over* another category.

We will draw on the work of [Ahrens and Lumsdaine](ahrens-lumsdaine-2019), [BÃ©nabou](benabou-1985), [Borceux](borceux-hca-2), [Jacobs](jacobs-1999), and [Streicher](streicher-fcjb).
