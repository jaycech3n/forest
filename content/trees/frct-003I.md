We assume knowledge of basic categorical concepts such as categories, functors,
and natural transformations. The purpose of this lecture is to develop the
notion of a category *over* another category.

We will draw on the following materials:

![](ahrens-lumsdaine-2019)
![](benabou-1985)
![](borceux-hca-2)
![](jacobs-1999)
![](streicher-fcjb)

These lecture notes are deeply influenced by Thomas Streicher.
