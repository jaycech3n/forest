We assume knowledge of basic categorical concepts such as categories, functors,
and natural transformations. The purpose of this lecture is to develop the
notion of a category *over* another category.

We will draw on the following materials:

> - Ahrens and Lumsdaine. [Displayed Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04296).
> - Benabou. Fibered categories and the foundations of naive category theory.
> - Borceux. Handbook of Categorical Algebra 2: Categories and Structures.
> - Jacobs.  [Categorical Logic and Type Theory](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/courses/catlogic/jacobs.pdf) .
> - Streicher. [Fibered Categories à la Jean Bénabou](https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/FIBR/FiBo.pdf).

This material is deeply influenced by conversations with Thomas Streicher, as well as his writings.
