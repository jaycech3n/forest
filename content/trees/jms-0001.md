On this website, I organize my thoughts on a variety of topics at a granular level. Sometimes these thoughts are {{<cref tfmt-0007 "self-contained">}}, and at times I may organize them into larger {{<cref dpl-0001 "notebooks">}} or {{<cref frct-003I "lecture notes">}}. My nascent ideas about the design of {{<cref tfmt-0002 "tools for mathematical thought">}} are {{<cref tfmt-0001 "here">}}. I welcome collaboration on any of the topics represented in my forest.
