title: globally small fibrations
---

In ordinary category theory, a category $C$ is called *small* when the objects
of $C$ can be arranged into a set, and so can for every $x,y\in C$ the
collection of morphisms $x\to y$. It is useful to separate these two conditions
when we generalize them to fibrations. The latter is called *local smallness*
and is discussed and defined in [](frct-000F); the former is called *global
smallness* by Jacobs and factors through an important concept: the *generic object*.
