Let {#A#} be a dcpo; then the lift {#\Lift{A}#} is [positively generated](jms-0023).

{{%proof%}}
Let {#u=\prn{\phi,a}#} be an element of {#\Lift{A}#}. Note that {#u#} is equal to {#\bigsqcup_{p:\phi}u#}; as [definedness coincides with positivity](jms-001N) in lifted dcpos, we have {#\phi = \IsPos\,u#}, and so we are done.
