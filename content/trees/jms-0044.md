The underlying function {#p\Sub{I}:I\to I#} of the [generic element](jms-0041) {#p\Sub{I}:I\multimap I#} of the [generic cone](jms-0041) {#p\Sub{\bullet}:\Prod{X:\Comma{A}{\UU}}I\multimap X#} under {#I \equiv \widetilde{\SemicohStr}#} [has been equipped](jms-0042) with the structure of a quasi-idempotent in the sense of [Shulman](shulman-2016), so we may split it.

In particular, the construction of [Shulman](shulman-2016) gives us a type {#J#} together with a retraction {#r : I\to J#} and a section {#s : J \to I#} witnessed by a homotopy {#\rho:\TpHtpy{J\to J}{s;r}{\Idn{J}}#}, such that {#r;s\equiv p\Sub{I} : I \to I#} definitionally. Our goal is to lift this splitting of the underlying function {#p\Sub{I}:I\to I#} to a splitting of the homomorphism {#p\Sub{I}:I\multimap I#}.

We may equip {#J#} with the structure of a [reflection algebra](jms-003O) by setting {#\eta\Sub{J} :\equiv \eta\Sub{I};r#}, making {#r : I \multimap J#} a homomorphism of algebras definitionally, i.e. {#\eta\Sub{r}a:\equiv \Refl#}. To exhibit {#s : J \multimap I#} as a homomorphism of algebras, we may likewise use reflexivity:

{##
  \begin{array}{l}
    \eta\Sub{s}:\TpHtpy{A\to I}{\eta\Sub{J};s}{\eta\Sub{I}}\\
    \eta\Sub{s}a :\equiv \Refl
  \end{array}
##}

That the above is well-defined can be deduced as follows, using the fact that the splitting of {#p\Sub{I}\equiv r;s#} is definitional and that {#p\Sub{I}#} is a definitional homomorphism:
{##
  \begin{aligned}
    s\prn{\eta\Sub{J}a} &\equiv s\prn{r\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}}
    \\
    &\equiv p\Sub{I}\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}
    \\
    &\equiv \eta\Sub{I}a
  \end{aligned}
##}


We have to check that the homotopy of functions {#\rho : \TpHtpy{J\to J}{s;r}{\Idn{J}}#} lifts to a [homotopy of homomorphisms](jms-003X). In particular, we must construct the coherence {#\bar\rho#} specified below:

{##
  \bar{\rho} : 
  \Prod{a:A}
  \TpIdn{
    \TpIdn{J}{r\prn{s\prn{\eta\Sub{J}a}}}{\eta\Sub{J}a}
  }{
    \rho\prn{\eta\Sub{J}a} \bullet \eta\Sub{\Idn{J}}a 
  }{
    \eta\Sub{s;r}a
  }
##}

Recalling the definition of the algebra structure on {#J#} and the definitions of the coherence data {#\eta\Sub{s},\eta\Sub{r}#} as well as the definition of [identities and compositions of homomorphisms](jms-0043), we simplify the specification above to showing that the identification {#\rho\prn{r\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}}#} is the trivial one.

{##
  \bar\rho\, a:
  \TpIdn{
    \TpIdn{J}{
      \eta\Sub{J}a
    }{
      \eta\Sub{J}a
    }
  }{
    \rho\prn{r\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}} 
  }{
    \Refl
  }
##}

By Theorem 7.1 of [Shulman](shulman-2016), 
We recall from Theorem 3.3 of [Shulman](shulman-2016) that the homotopy {#\rho#} induces a new witness of pre-idempotency for {#p\Sub{I}#}, namely {#\chi' x :\equiv \Con{ap}\Sub{s}\prn{\rho\prn{rx}}#} and that by Theorem 7.1 of the same, we this homotopy is equal to our original witness {#\chi : \TpHtpy{I\to I}{p\Sub{I};p\Sub{I}}{p\Sub{I}}#}. Therefore we have {#\Con{ap}\Sub{s}\prn{\rho\prn{rx}} = \vartheta\Sub{x}p\Sub{I}#}; because {#s#} is a section or {#r#}, this implies that {#\rho\prn{r x} = \Con{ap}\Sub{r}\prn{\vartheta\Sub{x}p\Sub{I}}#} and so we may compute our identification {#\bar\rho\, a#} as follows:
{##
  \begin{aligned}
    \rho\prn{r\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}}
    &= \Con{ap}\Sub{r}\prn{\vartheta\Sub{\eta\Sub{I}a}p\Sub{I}}
    \\
    &\equiv \Con{ap}\Sub{r} \prn{\eta\Sub{p\Sub{I}}a}
    \\
    &\equiv \Con{ap}\Sub{r}\Refl
    \\
    &\equiv \Refl
  \end{aligned}
##}

Above we have used the fact that the coherence datum {#\eta\Sub{p\Sub{I}}a#} is reflexivity.
