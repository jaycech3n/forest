The underlying function {#p\Sub{I}:I\to I#} of the [generic element](jms-0041) {#p\Sub{I}:I\multimap I#} of the [generic cone](jms-0041) {#p\Sub{\bullet}:\Prod{X:\Comma{A}{\UU}}I\multimap X#} under {#I \equiv \widetilde{\SemicohStr}#} [has been equipped](jms-0042) with the structure of a quasi-idempotent in the sense of [Shulman](shulman-2016), so we may split it.

In particular, the construction of [Shulman](shulman-2016) gives us a type {#J#} together with a retraction {#r : I\to J#} and a section {#s : J \to I#} witnessed by a homotopy {#\rho:\TpHtpy{J\to J}{s;r}{\Idn{J}}#}, such that {#r;s\equiv p\Sub{I} : I \to I#} definitionally. Our goal is to lift this splitting of the underlying function {#p\Sub{I}:I\to I#} to a splitting of the homomorphism {#p\Sub{I}:I\multimap I#}.

We may equip {#J#} with the structure of a [reflection algebra](jms-003O) by setting {#\eta\Sub{J} :\equiv \eta\Sub{I};r#}, making {#r : I \multimap J#} a homomorphism of algebras definitionally, i.e. {#\eta\Sub{r}a:\equiv \Refl#}. To exhibit {#s : J \multimap I#} as a homomorphism of algebras, we equip it with the following homotopy (recalling that {#p\Sub{I}#} is a *definitional* homomorphism):

{##
  \begin{array}{l}
    \eta\Sub{s}:\TpHtpy{A\to I}{\eta\Sub{J};s}{\eta\Sub{I}}\\
    \eta\Sub{s}a :\equiv \sigma\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}
  \end{array}
##}

**TODO: show that {#\rho,\sigma#} lift to [homotopies of homomorphisms](jms-003X); in the previous draft, I had a bit flipped.**
