The underlying function {#p\Sub{I}:I\to I#} of the [generic element](jms-0041) {#p\Sub{I}:I\multimap I#} of the [generic cone](jms-0041) {#p\Sub{\bullet}:\Prod{X:\Comma{A}{\UU}}I\multimap X#} under {#I \equiv \widetilde{\SemicohStr}#} [has been equipped](jms-0042) with the structure of a quasi-idempotent in the sense of [Shulman](shulman-2016), so we may split it.

In particular, we have a type {#J#} together with a retraction {#r : I\to J#} and a section {#s : J \to I#} together with homotopies {#\rho:\TpHtpy{J\to J}{s;r}{\Idn{I}}#} and {#\sigma : \TpHtpy{I\to I}{r;s}{p\Sub{I}}#}. Our goal is to lift this splitting of the underlying function to a splitting of the homomorphism.

We may equip {#J#} with the structure of a [reflection algebra](jms-003O) by setting {#\eta\Sub{J} :\equiv \eta\Sub{I};r#}, making {#r : I \multimap J#} a homomorphism of algebras definitionally, i.e. {#\eta\Sub{r}a:\equiv \Refl#}. To exhibit {#s : J \multimap I#} as a homomorphism of algebras, we equip it with the following homotopy (recalling that {#p\Sub{I}#} is a *definitional* homomorphism):

{##
  \begin{array}{l}
    \eta\Sub{s}:\TpHtpy{A\to I}{\eta\Sub{J};s}{\eta\Sub{I}}\\
    \eta\Sub{s}a :\equiv \sigma\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}
  \end{array}
##}

**TODO: show that {#\rho,\sigma#} lift to [homotopies of homomorphisms](jms-003X); in the previous draft, I had a bit flipped.**

<!-- 
We must exhibit {#\rho : \TpHtpy{J\to J}{s;r}{\Idn{I}}#} as a [homotopy of homomorphisms](jms-003X) {#\rho : s;r\approx \Idn{I}#}. In particular, we must define {#
\bar\rho : \Prod{a:A} \rho\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}\bullet \eta\Sub{\Idn{I}} a = \eta\Sub{s;r}a
#}; computing further, for each {#a:A#} we must identify {#\rho\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}#} with {#\eta\Sub{s;r}a#}. We procede by computing the latter, recalling the [construction of composite homomorphisms](jms-0043):

{##
  \begin{aligned}
  \eta\Sub{s;r}a &\equiv \Con{ap}\Sub{r}\prn{\eta\Sub{s}a}\bullet \eta\Sub{r}a\\
  &\equiv 
  \Con{ap}\Sub{r}\prn{\sigma\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}}\bullet \eta\Sub{r}a
  \\
  &\equiv \Con{ap}\Sub{r}\prn{\sigma\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}}\bullet \Refl
  \\
  &\equiv 
  \Con{ap}\Sub{r}\prn{\sigma\prn{\eta\Sub{I}a}}
  \end{aligned}
##}

**TODO: Does the rest of the coherence hold? If so, it definitely relies on the specifics of Mike's construction. First of all, I observe that in Mike's construction, we actually have {#s;r \equiv \Idn{I}#} definitionally, so this first goal is actually trivial if we allow ourselves to know that. On the other hand, it could be non-trivial to exhibit {#\sigma : r;s \sim p\Sub{I}#} as a homotopy of homomorphisms.** -->
