There exists a reflection algebra {#A\Sub{\UU} :\Comma{A}{\UU}#} such that for any other reflection algebra {#X:\Comma{A}{\UU}#}, the space of homomorphisms {#A\Sub{\UU}\multimap X#} is contractible.

{{%proof%}}
Our [splitting of the generic element of the generic cone](jms-0044) over the identity functor on reflection algebras [yields a new (incoherent) cone](jms-003E) {#\Mor{q}{\Delta J}{\Idn{\Comma{A}{\UU}}}#} whose generic element {#q\Sub{J}:J\multimap J#} may be identified with the identity homomorphism. It [follows](jms-003B) that each  space of homomorphisms {#J\to X#} is contractible.
