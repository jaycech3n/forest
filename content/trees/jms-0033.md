A morphism {#\Mor{p}{E}{B}#} in a category {#\mathcal{C}#} is said to be *carrable* when for any {#\Mor{f}{A}{B}#}, the pullback {#\Mor{f^*p}{E\times_{B}A}{A}#} depicted below exists.

```render-latex
\DiagramSquare{
  nw/style = pullback,
  nw = E\times_{B}A,
  ne = E,
  se = B,
  sw = A,
  south = f,
  east = p,
  west = f^*p,
  north = p^*f,
  west/style = {->,exists},
  north/style = {->,exists},
}
```
