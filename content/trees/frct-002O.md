Let {#\mathscr{M}#} be a model of [ETCS](lawvere-1964-etcs); and let {#\mathfrak{C}#} be a
class of families of sets in {#\mathscr{M}#}. Then {#\mathfrak{C}#} is a class of
objects in the fundamental self-indexing {#\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}#} over
{#\mathscr{M}#}.  Furthermore, {#\mathscr{M}#} a definable class in
{#\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}#} in the sense of [](frct-002W) if and only if it is a definable class of families of sets in the sense of [](frct-002P).
