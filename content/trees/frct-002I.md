Let {#\bar{s}#} be a displayed object in a cartesian fibration {#E#} over {#B#}. A pair of displayed morphisms {#\Mor{f,g}{\bar{x}}{\bar{y}}\in E#} are said to *agree on {#\bar{s}#}-figures* when for any [{#\bar{s}#}-figure](frct-002K) {#\Mor{h}{\bar{z}}{\bar{x}}#}, we have {#\Mor{h;f = h;g}{\bar{z}}{\bar{y}}#}.
