title: small fibrations and internal categories
macrolib: topos
---

The purpose of this section is to develop the relationship between *internal
categories* (categories defined in the internal language of a category $B$) and
cartesian fibrations over $B$, generalizing the relationship between categories internal
to $\SET$ (i.e. small categories) and their family fibrations over $\SET$.
