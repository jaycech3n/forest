title: small fibrations and internal categories
macros:
- include: base-macros

The purpose of this section is to develop the relationship between *internal
categories* (categories defined in the internal language of a category {#B#}) and
cartesian fibrations over {#B#}, generalizing the relationship between categories internal
to {#\SET#} (i.e. small categories) and their family fibrations over {#\SET#}.
