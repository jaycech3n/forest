Given a pair of [reflection algebras](jms-003O) {#X,Y:\Comma{\UU}{A}#} and a pair of [homomorphisms](jms-003O) {#f,g : X\multimap Y#}, a *homotopy* from {#f#} to {#g#} is defined to be a homotopy {#\phi : Uf\sim Ug#} between the underlying functions together with a witness {#\bar{\phi}#}  of the following coherence:

{##\Prod{a:A}\TpIdn{\TpIdn{Y}{f\prn{\eta\Sub{X}a}}{\eta\Sub{Y}a}}{\phi\prn{\eta\Sub{X}a}\bullet \eta\Sub{g}a}{\eta\Sub{f}a}##}

We shall write {#f\approx g#} for the type of homotopies from {#f#} to {#g#}.

**TODO: Did I get this right ??**
