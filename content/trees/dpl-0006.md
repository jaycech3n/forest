The most basic construct of duploid theory is a {{<cref dpl-0002>}}, a variant
on the concept of a *precategory* that relaxes the associativity axiom to reflect
the evaluation order of execution in effectful programming languages and proof
theories. In this section, we define deductive systems and develop their basic
properties.
