Working in univalent foundations, let {#\UU\in\VV#} be a pair of not-necessarily-univalent universes such that {#\UU#} is closed under {#\VV#}-small products of {#\UU#}-small types; then the subuniverse inclusion {#\Mor{j}{\UU}{\VV}#} is *reflective*. This argument will combine ideas due to [Awodey, Frey, Speight](awodey-frey-speight-2018), and [Shulman](https://homotopytypetheory.org/2018/11/26/impredicative-encodings-part-3/). For any type {#A:\VV#}, we will define the reflection of {#A#} in {#\UU#} in several steps.

Our [main theorem](jms-004H) then follows from [wild categorical](jms-003A) considerations, as we show below.
