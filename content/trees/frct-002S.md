macros:
- include: frct-001X

We will now construe [](frct-002Q) as the instantiation at the fundamental
self-indexing {#\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}#} of a more general notion of
definability for classes of objects in a cartesian fibration, defined
forthwith. The following definition of definability in a cartesian fibration is due to Bénabou, but is discussed in print by [Borceux](borceux-hca-2), [Jacobs](jacobs-1999), and [Streicher](streicher-fcjb).
