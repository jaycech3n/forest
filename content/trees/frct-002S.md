We will now construe [](frct-002Q) as the instantiation at the fundamental
self-indexing $\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}$ of a more general notion of
definability for classes of objects in a cartesian fibration, defined
forthwith. The following definition of definability in a cartesian fibration is due to Bénabou, but is discussed in print by Borceux, Jacobs, and Streicher.
