Let {#A#} be a pointed continuous dcpo presented by a basis {#B\subseteq A#} for each element {#b\in B#} it is decidable whether {#b=\bot#}. Then {#A#} is [positively generated](jms-0023).

{{%proof "Constructive proof"%}}
We observe that [every element of {#B#} is non-negatively generated](jms-002I), so we [may conclude](jms-0026) that {#A#} is [positively generated](jms-0023).
