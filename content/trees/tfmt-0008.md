{{<cref tfmt-0007 "Atomicity">}} in {{<cref tfmt-0003 "evergreen mathematical notes">}} is enhanced by adhering to the following principles:

1. **no free variables:** do not rely on one-off objects that are defined incidentally upwards in the hierarchy; turn them into atomic nodes that can be linked;
2. **favor explicit dependency:** whenever using a terminology or construction that has been defined elsewhere, link it;
3. **notation should be decodable:** all notations (except the most very basic) should be recalled via a link.

It can be a bit excessive to link every word: but the pertinent links could be added to a "related pages" section.
