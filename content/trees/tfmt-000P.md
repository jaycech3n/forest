Although diagramming may seem to non-mathematicians to be somewhat orthogonal to notational macro support, in **reality any solution to the diagramming problem must be tightly and natively integrated with the rendering of mathematical expressions** --- simply because most diagrams involve mathematical expressions, and these invariably involve notational macros. The reason PGF/TikZ has been so successful is that it respects this tight coupling.
