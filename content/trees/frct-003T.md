Let {#E#} be a [displayed category](frct-0000) over {#C#}; following [Ahrens and Lumsdaine](ahrens-lumsdaine-2019), we define a *cleaving* of {#E#} to be a function assigning to each {#\Mor{f}{x}{y}\in C#}  and {#u\in C_y#} a [cartesian morphism](frct-0001) {#\DispMor{\bar{f}}{f}{\InvImg{f}u}{u}#} in {#E#} called the *chosen cartesian lift* of {#u#} along {#f#}.
