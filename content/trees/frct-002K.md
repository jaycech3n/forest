Let {#E#} be a cartesian fibration and let {#\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}\subseteq E#} be the full subfibration determined by a displayed object {#\bar{s}\in E#} as in [](frct-0010). We now develop the following vocabulary:

1. We will refer to each object of {#\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}#} as a {#\bar{s}#}-figure
shape.

2. A displayed morphism {#\bar{z}\to \bar{x}#} is called a {#\bar{s}#}-figure whenever {#\bar{z}\in\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}#}.
