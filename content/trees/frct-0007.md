Suppose that {#E#} is displayed over {#B#} and {#\Mor{F}{X}{B}#} is a
functor; then we may define a displayed category {#\InvImg{F}E#} as over {#X#} follows:

1. An object of {#(\InvImg{F}E)\Sub{x}#} is an object of {#E\Sub{Fx}#}.

2. Given {#\bar{x}\in (\InvImg{F}E)\Sub{x}#}, {#\bar{y}\in (\InvImg{F}E)\Sub{y}#} and {#f : x \to y#}, a morphism {#\bar{x}\DispTo{f}\bar{y}#} in {#\InvImg{F}E#} is given by a morphism {#\bar{x}\DispTo{Ff}\bar{y}#} in {#E#}.

We visualize the change of base scenario as follows:
```render-latex
\DiagramSquare{
  nw/style = pullback,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  height = 1.5cm,
  nw = \InvImg{F}{E},
  ne = E,
  sw = X,
  se = B,
  south = F,
}
```
