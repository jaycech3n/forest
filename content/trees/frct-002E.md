Let {#E#} be an ordinary category. In general,
to compare two morphisms {#\Mor{f,g}{x}{y}#} in {#E#}, it is not enough to see if they agree on global points {#\Mor{u}{1}{x}#}, because the behavior of {#f,g#} may differ only on generalized elements. In some cases, however, there is a family of objects {#\prn{s\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}\in E#} are together *adequate* for comparing morphisms of {#E#} in the sense of [separating families](frct-002G) below.

We will now generalize the notion of [separating family](frct-002G) to the case of a cartesian fibration.
