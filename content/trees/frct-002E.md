title: separators for cartesian fibrations

Let $E$ be an ordinary category. In general,
to compare two morphisms $f,g:x\to y$ in $E$, it is not enough to see if they
agree on global points $u:1\to x$, because the behavior of $u,v$ may differ
only on generalized elements. In some cases, however, there is a family of
objects $\prn{s\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}\in E$ are together *adequate* for comparing
morphisms of $E$ in the sense of {{<cref frct-002G>}} below.

{{<child frct-002G>}}
{{<child frct-003L>}}
{{<child frct-002F>}}

We will now generalize {{<cref frct-002G>}} to the case of a cartesian fibration.

{{<child frct-002I>}}
{{<child frct-002H>}}
