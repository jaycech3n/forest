title: cartesian closure of the meta-category of all categories
taxon: Remark
---

Consequently there exists a meta-category $\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Cat}}$ of all
categories. Following [Lawvere](http://rfcwalters.blogspot.com/2010/10/old-post-why-are-we-concerned-fw.html) (but deviating from some other authors that
ground the notion of meta-categories in *classes*) we notice that
$\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Cat}}$ is cartesian closed; in other words, all functor
categories exist regardless of size.

**Assumption.** At times we may assume that there exists a *category*
$\SET\subseteq\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Coll}}$ of collections that we will refer
to as sets, such that $\SET$ is closed under the axioms of ETCS. Rather than work with $\SET$ at all
times, our approach is to use the tools of relative category theory to
objectify the notions of "small" and "locally small" category over any category
$B$, generalizing the role of $\SET$ from classical category theory.
