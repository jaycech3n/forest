When a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo {#A#} satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions, we will refer to it as *positively generated*.

1. Every element {#a: A#} is [positively generated](jms-002F), i.e. we have {#a = \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#}.

2. For any semidirected subset {#I\subseteq A#}, we have {#\bigsqcup I = \bigsqcup \brc{a\in I \mid \IsPos\,a}#}.

(2) implies (1) by setting {#I = \brc{a}#}. Conversely, assume that each element is the supremum of its positive part and fix a semidirected subset {#I\subseteq A#}. We compute:
{##
\bigsqcup\brc{a \in I \mid \IsPos\,a}
= 
\bigsqcup_{a\in \brc{a \in I\mid \IsPos\,a}}a
=
\bigsqcup_{a\in I}\bigsqcup_{p\in \IsPos\,a} a
= 
\bigsqcup_{a\in I} a
##}
