Let {#A#} be a pointed continuous dcpo presented by a basis {#B\subseteq A#} such each element of {#B#} is [non-negatively generated](jms-002J) in {#A#}. Then {#A#} is [positively generated](jms-0023).

{{%proof "Constructive proof"%}}
We must show that for any {#a\in A#}, we have {#a \leq \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#}. Let {#B_a#} be the subset {#\brc{b \in B \mid b\ll a}#}. By assumption, it suffices to check that {#\bigsqcup B_a \leq \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#}. Fixing {#b\in B_a#}, we must check that {#b\leq \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#}. 

As {#b#} is assumed to be [non-negatively generated](jms-002J), we have {#b=\bigsqcup_{p:\lnot\prn{b=\bot}}b#} so to check {#b\leq\bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#} it suffices to check that {#\lnot\prn{b=\bot}#} implies that {#a#} is positive. We fix semidirected {#J\subseteq A#} such that {#a\leq \bigsqcup{J} = \bigsqcup\prn{\brc{\bot}\cup J}#} to check that {#J#} is inhabited. We recall that {#b\ll a#} and {#a\leq \bigsqcup{\brc{\bot}\cup J}#}, so it follows by the definition of the way-below relation that either {#b\leq \bot#} or there exists {#j\in J#} such that {#b\leq j#}. The first case is contradictory by our assumption that {#\lnot\prn{b=\bot}#}, and the second case verifies that {#J#} is inhabited, so {#a#} is positive.
