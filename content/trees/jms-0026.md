Let {#A#} be a pointed continuous dcpo presented by a basis {#B\subseteq A#} containing the bottom element such that for any {#b\in B#}, it is decidable whether {#b=\bot#}. Then {#A#} is [positively generated](jms-0023).

{{%proof "Constructive proof"%}}
We must show that for any {#a\in A#}, we have {#a \leq \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#}. Let {#B_a#} be the subset {#\brc{b \in B \mid b\ll a}#}. 
 By assumption, it suffices to check that {#\bigsqcup B_a \leq \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#}. Fixing {#b\in B_a#} to check that {#b\leq \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}a#}, we proceed by case on whether {#b=\bot#}:
 
 1. If {#b=\bot#}, then we are done.
 2. If {#b\not=\bot#}, we will show that {#a#} is positive. We fix semidirected {#J\subseteq A#} such that {#a\leq \bigsqcup{J} = \bigsqcup\prn{\brc{\bot}\cup J}#} to check that {#J#} is inhabited. We recall that {#b\ll a#} and {#a\leq \bigsqcup{\brc{\bot}\cup J}#}, so it follows by the definition of the way-below relation that either {#b\let \bot#} or there exists {#j\in J#} such that {#b\leq j#}. The first case is contradictory, and the second case verifies that {#J#} is inhabited, so {#a#} is positive.
