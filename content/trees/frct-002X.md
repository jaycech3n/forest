Recall that the [fundamental self-indexing](frct-001X) {#\SelfIx{B}#} of a category {#B#} is a displayed category with {#\SelfIx{B}\Sub{x} = \Sl{B}{x}#}. Recall that [{#\SelfIx{B}#} is a cartesian fibration over {#B#} if and only if {#B#} has pullbacks](frct-001Y). However, {#\SelfIx{B}#} is unconditionally a *cocartesian* fibration.
