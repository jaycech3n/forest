title: revisiting the fundamental self-indexing

Recall that the fundamental self-indexing {#\SelfIx{B}#} {%pref 001X %} of a category {#B#}
is a displayed category with {#\SelfIx{B}\Sub{x} = \Sl{B}{x}#}.
As discussed in [](frct-001Y), {#\SelfIx{B}#} is a cartesian fibration over {#B#} if and
only if {#B#} has pullbacks. However, {#\SelfIx{B}#} is unconditionally a *cocartesian*
fibration.
