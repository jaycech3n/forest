A *forest of [evergreen notes](tfmt-0003)* (or a *forest* for short) is loosely defined to be a collection of [evergreen notes](tfmt-0003) in which multiple [hierarchical structures](tfmt-0005) are allowed to emerge and evolve over time. Concretely, one note may contextualize several other notes via transclusion within its textual structure; in the context of a forest, we refer to an individual note as a *tree*.

Of course, a tree can be viewed as a forest that has a root node.
