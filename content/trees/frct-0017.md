A displayed category {#E#} over {#B#} is a *cocartesian fibration* when for each {#f : x \to y\in B#} and {#\bar{x}\in E\Sub{x}#}, there exists a displayed object {#\bar{y}\in E\Sub{y}#} and a *cocartesian* morphism {#\bar{f} : \bar{x}\DispTo{f} \bar{y}#}.

Cocartesian fibrations are also known as *opfibrations*.
