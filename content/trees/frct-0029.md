title: an alternative definition of fibration

---

**Warning.** Some authors including Grothendieck give an
equivalent definition of cartesian fibration that factors through a
*nonequivalent* definition of cartesian morphisms. Such authors refer to our
notion of cartesian morphism as *hypercartesian*.

Grothendieck defines a fibration in terms of (what we refer
to as) hypocartesian morphisms rather than (what we refer to as) cartesian
morphisms, and therefore imposes the additional constraint that the
hypocartesian morphisms be closed under composition. In [](frct-002B) below, we
verify that these two definitions of cartesian fibration coincide.
