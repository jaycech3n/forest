title: an alternative definition of fibration

---

**Warning.** Some authors including [Grothendieck](sga-1) give an equivalent definition of cartesian fibration that factors through a *nonequivalent* definition of cartesian morphisms. Such authors refer to our notion of cartesian morphism as *hypercartesian* (see [Streicher](streicher-fcjb)).

[Grothendieck](sga-1) defines a fibration in terms of (what we refer to as) hypocartesian morphisms rather than (what we refer to as) cartesian morphisms, and therefore imposes the additional constraint that the hypocartesian morphisms be closed under composition. [Below](frct-002B), we verify that these two definitions of cartesian fibration coincide.
