In classical mathematics, every {#\LiftM#}-algebra is free; this does not appear to be asserted by constructive mathematics, but in this section we verify that freeness can be characterized in terms of positivity. The [main result](jms-002B) is that a pointed dcpo {#A#} is [positively generated](jms-0023) if and only the evident map {#\Mor{}{\Lift{A^+}}{A}#} is an isomorphism.
