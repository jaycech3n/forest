Let {#E#} be a cartesian fibration over {#B#} such that {#B#} has
binary products. A displayed object {#\bar{s}\in E\Sub{s}#} is said to be a
*small separator* for {#E#} when any two vertical maps {#f,g:\bar{u}\DispTo{\Idn{x}}\bar{v}\in E\Sub{x}#} are equal when they are agree on {#\bar{s}#}-figures in the sense of [](frct-002I).
