The phrase *evergreen note* is due to [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org), who has [written extensively](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) about it in his [public Zettelkasten](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). Evergreen notes are permanent notes that evolve and accumulate over time, cutting across different projects.
