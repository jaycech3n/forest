Let {#A#} be a pointed continuous dcpo presented by a basis {#B\subseteq A#} whose elements are all [positively generated](jms-002F) in {#A#}. Then {#A#} is [positively generated](jms-0023).

{{%proof%}}
As [positive generation implies non-negative generation](jms-002N) for an element of a pointed dcpo, we [may conclude](jms-0026) that {#A#} is positively generated.
