Let {#i\sqsubseteq j#} in a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo {#A#} such that {#i#} is [positive](jms-001M); then {#j#} is [positive](jms-001M).

{{%proof%}}
Fixing semidirected {#J\subseteq A#} such that {#j\sqsubseteq \bigsqcup{J}#}, we must show that {#J#} is inhabited. This follows from our assumption that {#i#} is positive becuase {#i\sqsubseteq j\sqsubseteq \bigsqcup{J}#}.
