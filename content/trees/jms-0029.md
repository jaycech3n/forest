Let {#i\leq j#} in a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo {#A#} such that {#i#} is positive; then {#j#} is positive.

{{%proof "Constructive proof"%}}
Fixing semidirected {#J\subseteq A#} such that {#j\leq \bigsqcup{J}#}, we must show that {#J#} is inhabited. This follows from our assumption that {#i#} is positive becuase {#i\leq j\leq \bigsqcup{J}#}.
