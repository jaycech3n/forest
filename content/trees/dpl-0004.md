Let {#f:C \vdash D#} be a morphism in a [deductive system](dpl-0002) {#\mathcal{D}#}.

1. We say that {#f#} is *linear* when for all {#g:B\vdash C#} and {#h:A\vdash B#}, we
   have {#h;\prn{g;f} = \prn{h;g};f#}.

2. We say that {#f#} is *thunkable* when for all {#g:D\vdash E#} and $h : E\vdash
   F{#, we have #}f;\prn{g;h} = \prn{f;g};h$.
