Equivalently, we can define a [duploid](jms-0050) to be a [univalent](jms-004T) [preduploid](jms-004F) such that every object is *merely equipped with* both an [upshift](jms-004M) and a [downshift](jms-004P).

{{%proof%}}
To see that the [main definition](jms-0050) implies our alternative definition, let {#A#} be an object of the preduploid; because we are proving that {#A#} is *merely equipped with* both an [upshift](jms-004M) and a [downshift](jms-004P), we may proceed by cases on the [polarization](jms-0045) of {#A#}.

1. If {#A#} is [positive](jms-004B), we choose the identity map {#A\vdash A#} for the downshift and we use our assumption to deduce that {#A#} has an upshift.
2. If {#A#} is [negative](jms-004B), we choose the identity map {#A\vdash A#} for the upshift we we use our assumption to deduce that {#A#} has a downshift.

Conversely, assume that every object is merely equipped with both an upshift and a downshift. That a positive object {#P#} has an upshift [is a proposition](jms-004X), so we can use our assumption that {#P#} *merely* has an upshift. That a negative object {#N#} has a downshift [is likewise a proposition](jms-004Z), so we can use our assumption that {#N#} *merely* has a downshift.
