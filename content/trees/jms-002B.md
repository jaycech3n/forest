A [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo {#A#} is lifted if and only if it is [positively generated](jms-0023).

{{%proof "Constructive proof"%}}
This follows from two existing lemmas:
1. [Lifted dcpos (free algebras) are positively generated](jms-0025).
2. [Positively generated pointed dcpos are free](jms-002B).
