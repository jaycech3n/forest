Let {#E#} be a cartesian fibration over {#B#}; a *generic object* for {#E#} is defined to be an object {#\bar{u}\in \TotCat{E}#}  such that for any {#\bar{z}\in \TotCat{E}#} there exists a cartesian map {#\bar{z}\to \bar{u}#}.

**Warning.** Our terminology differs from that of [Jacobs](jacobs-1999); what we refer to as a *generic object* here is [Jacobs](jacobs-1999)' *weak generic object*. We prefer the unqualified terminology, as generic objects in the stronger sense are very rare.
