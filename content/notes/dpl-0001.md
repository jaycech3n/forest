This is an investigation of Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni's theory of duploids, working in the setting of {{<cref dpl-000B "univalent foundations">}}. Most of what we do could be done in non-univalent foundations; the purpose of univalence is to sharpen our perspective on the relationship between structure and property in duploid theory.
