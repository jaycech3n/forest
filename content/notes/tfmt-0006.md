Multiple hierarchical structures can be imposed on the same associative network of nodes. As a result, any interface for navigating the neighbor-relation would need to take account of **all** parent nodes. Most hypertext tools assume that the position of a node in the hierarchy is unique, and therefore have a single "next/previous" navigation interface; we must investigate the design of interfaces that surface all parent/neighbor relations.
