{{<cref tfmt-0007 "Atomicity">}} in {{<cref tfmt-0003 "evergreen mathematical notes">}} can be achieved in the following ways:
1. whenever using a terminology or construction that has been defined elsewhere, link it.
2. all notations (except the most very basic) should be recalled via a link.

It can be a bit excessive to link every word: but the pertinent links could be added to a "related pages" section; it could also be useful to investigate dedicated link sections for "what you need in order to understand this note".
