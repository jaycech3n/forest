Grothendieck defines a fibration in terms of (what we refer
to as) hypocartesian morphisms rather than (what we refer to as) cartesian
morphisms, and therefore imposes the additional constraint that the
hypocartesian morphisms be closed under composition. In {{<cref frct-002B>}} below, we
verify that these two definitions of cartesian fibration coincide.
