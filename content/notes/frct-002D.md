title: two ways to generalize pullbacks
taxon: Remark
---

{{<cref frct-002A "Hypocartesian">}} and {{<cref frct-0001 "cartesian">}}
morphisms can be thought
of as two distinct ways to generalize the concept of a pullback, depending on
what one considers the essential properties of pullbacks. Hypocartesian
morphisms more directly generalize the "little picture" universal property of
pullbacks as limiting cones, whereas cartesian morphisms generalize the "big
picture" dynamics of the pullback pasting lemma. As we have seen in {{<cref frct-002C>}} these two notions coincide in any cartesian fibration; the instance of
this result for the {{<cref frct-001X "fundamental self-indexing">}} verifies that
pullbacks can be equivalently presented in terms of cartesian morphisms, as we
have pointed out in {{<cref frct-001Y>}}.
