A class of sets $\mathfrak{C}$ is sometimes said to be *formally
definable* when there is a formula $\prn{x \mid
\phi\Sub{\mathfrak{C}}\prn{x}}$ in the language of set theory such that a
set $S$ lies in $\mathfrak{C}$ if and only if
$\phi\Sub{\mathfrak{C}}\prn{S}$ holds. This concept is a bit sensitive, as
it presupposes that we have a notion of "class" whose constituents are not
all definable in this sense.

A better behaved notion of definability for sets than the formal one is
given *model-theoretically*, i.e. relative to a model $\mathscr{M}$ of set
theory in some ambient set theory. We will refer to
an element of $\mathscr{M}$ as a set, and a subcollection of $\mathscr{M}$
as a class.
