The following are equivalent for a deductive system $\mathcal{D}$:

1. every map is {{<cref dpl-0004 linear>}};
2. every map is {{<cref dpl-0004 thunkable>}};
3. every object is {{<cref dpl-0005 positive>}};
5. every object is {{<cref dpl-0005 negative>}};
6. the **cut** law is associative;
7. $\mathcal{D}$ is a category.

Supposing that every map is linear, we must check that each $f:A\vdash B$ is thunkable. Fixing $g:B\vdash C$ and $h:C\vdash D$, we must check that $f;\prn{g;h} = \prn{f;g};h$; as $h$ is assumed linear, the equation holds. The converse holds by identical reasoning.

Clearly every object is positive if and only if every map is linear; likewise, every object is negative if and only if every map is thunkable.

Finally, when every map is both linear and thunkable, the cut law is associative --- but this is exactly the condition that the deductive system give rise to a category.
