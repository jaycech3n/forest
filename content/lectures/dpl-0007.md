The following are equivalent for a deductive system $\mathcal{D}$:

1. every map is {{<cref dpl-0004 linear>}};
2. every map is {{<cref dpl-0004 thunkable>}};
3. every object is {{<cref dpl-0005 positive>}};
5. every object is {{<cref dpl-0005 negative>}};
6. the **cut** law is associative;
7. $\mathcal{D}$ is a category.
