Let $f:C \vdash D$ be a morphism in a deductive system $\mathcal{D}$.

1. We say that $f$ is *linear* when for all $g:B\vdash C$ and $h:A\vdash B$, we
   have $h;\prn{g;f} = \prn{h;g};f$.

2. We say that $f$ is *thunkable* when for all $g:D\vdash E$ and $h : E\vdash
   F$, we have $f;\prn{g;h} = \prn{f;g};h$.
